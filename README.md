## Features

- [x] ‚ÑπÔ∏è Add TableCellConfigurator features

The library requires a dependency [AppViewUtilits](https://github.com/moslienko/AppViewUtilits/).

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `TableCellConfigurator` in action. Simply open the `TableCellConfigurator.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

TableCellConfigurator is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'TableCellConfigurator'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate TableCellConfigurator into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "moslienko/TableCellConfigurator"
```

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` to build the framework and drag the built `TableCellConfigurator.xcframework` bundles from Carthage/Build into the "Frameworks and Libraries" section of your application‚Äôs Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/moslienko/TableCellConfigurator.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `TableCellConfigurator`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate TableCellConfigurator into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
